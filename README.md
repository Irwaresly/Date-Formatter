# Learn the Date Object by Building a Date Formatter

This project demonstrates building a date formatter using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript within the Visual Studio Code (VSCode) environment. The main goal is to showcase the functionality of the Date object and allow users to format the current date based on different options.

## Project Structure

- **HTML (`index.html`):**
  - The HTML file provides the structure for the webpage.
  - It includes a title, a decorative SVG element, a dropdown for date formatting options, and a paragraph to display the formatted date.

- **CSS (`styles.css`):**
  - The CSS file defines the styling for the webpage, using a dark background with contrasting text colors.
  - Styles include formatting for titles, SVG images, dropdowns, and responsive design for smaller screens.

- **JavaScript (`main.js`):**
  - The JavaScript file contains logic to interact with the Date object and update the displayed date based on user-selected formatting options.
  - It listens for changes in the dropdown and adjusts the displayed date accordingly.

## HTML Structure

- The HTML file includes a `main` section with a title, decorative SVG, a divider, a dropdown for date options, and a paragraph to display the formatted date.

## CSS Styling

- The CSS file provides styling for a visually appealing and responsive user interface.
- It uses custom variables for colors and ensures a good user experience on various screen sizes.

## JavaScript Functionality

- The JavaScript file initializes the date object and extracts day, month, year, hours, and minutes.
- It sets up an event listener on the dropdown to dynamically update the displayed date based on the selected formatting option.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Explore the different date formatting options available in the dropdown.
3. Observe how the displayed date changes dynamically based on the selected option.

Feel free to customize the code and experiment with additional date formatting options or UI enhancements.

## Responsive Design

The webpage is designed to be responsive, with adjustments for smaller screens. The title font size and dropdown width adapt to different screen sizes for an optimal user experience.
